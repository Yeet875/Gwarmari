Stir the mixture properly till all get mixed

Pour water to into the mixture stirring it continuously

See that you get a good paste of the mixture (the paste should be medium - neither too thin nor thick, it should drop easily onto the pan while cooking)

Keep the mixture for about 5 hours to get good taste (you can cook it immediately also)

Heat the pan pour the oil, let the oil heat nicely (make sure that the mixture dough when cooking deep into the oil)

Take about a table spoon of the mixture and drop into the hot oil. You can cook several of them at a time. 

See that all the doughs puff up 

Fry till they all become brown. 

Take those brownies out and soak the oil in a towel or a paper.
